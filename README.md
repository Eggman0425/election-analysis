# Election Audit Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide specific information to the Colorado Board of Elections to make sure the recent congressional election was counted correctly. The information included was the total number of votes, the total number of votes by county, identifying the largest county turnout, displaying each candidates tally and percentage, as well as the winning candidateâ€™s vote count and percentage.

## Summary
The script used to complete this election audit can also be used for any election. For example, if we wanted to take a closer look at the mayoral race in a specific city, we can modify this code to calculate the number and percentage of votes by district instead of county.

We could also look at larger elections, like the Governor election, and breakdown the winner by city. These modifications would each need the proper CSV files containing voter information in order to process the analysis.
